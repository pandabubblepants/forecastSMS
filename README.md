# forecastSMS

I ride my bike to work every morning, a 5 mile portion of my ride is along the lakefront trail in Chicago. The wind can severly vary in any direction depending on the day, and this affects my decisions on whether to ride or not. 

I made this script in order to get a text of the weather forecast each morning and afternoon just before I leave for my commute. 

This script is written entirely in python, using the Darksky API for weather, the darkskylib API wrapper, and the Twiliio API for sms handling.
